Step 1: Build an Orders Service
• Build a service that’s able to receive simple orders of shopping goods via a REST API
• Apples cost 60 cents and oranges cost 25 cents
• The service should return a summary of the order, including the cost of the order
• Add unit tests that validate your code

Step 2: Simple offer
• The shop decides to introduce two new offers
• buy one get one free on Apples
• 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
• Update your functions & unit tests accordingly

Step 3: Store and retrieve orders
• The service should now store the orders that a customer submits
• There should be an endpoint to get a particular order based on its ID
• There should be an endpoint to get all orders
• This store does not have to be to disk
• Update your functions & unit tests accordingly
